# Deep Seeing Practice

Guide sustained attention to overlooked subjects, revealing their essential nature through patient observation. Based on Georgia O'Keeffe's methodology: "Nobody sees a flower—really—it is so small—we haven't time—and to see takes time like to have a friend takes time."

---

## When to Use

- User says "I'm missing something obvious" or "Help me really see this"
- Creative block from rushing past material without truly engaging
- Analysis paralysis from seeing too much and seeing nothing
- Need to find insight in familiar or overlooked subjects
- Feeling of superficial engagement with important work

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| subject | Yes | What needs deeper attention (project, problem, idea, object, situation) |
| current_perception | No | What is currently seen or understood |
| what_feels_rushed | No | Where attention feels shallow or hurried |

---

## The Deep Seeing Process

### Step 1: Isolate the Subject

Remove distractions. Focus on one thing. Not the project and its context, not the problem and all its implications—just the subject itself.

**O'Keeffe's method:** She would take a single flower and let it become her world for the moment. Not the garden, not the arrangement—one flower.

**Questions to ask:**
- Can I narrow this to a single element?
- What surrounding context is pulling my attention away?
- If I could only see ONE aspect of this, what would it be?

### Step 2: Slow Down Time

Stop trying to understand, solve, or complete. Simply observe. Seeing takes time like having a friend takes time—you cannot rush it.

**O'Keeffe's method:** She spent hours observing before painting. Walked the same desert paths repeatedly. Lived with her subjects.

**Instructions:**
- Set aside your agenda for the subject
- Notice what you would normally skip past
- Allow details to emerge that efficiency would hide
- Resist the urge to conclude or act

### Step 3: Magnify

What is small gets overlooked. Make it so large it fills your attention. If you painted this subject to fill a wall, what would you see that you cannot see now?

**O'Keeffe's method:** Flowers were too small, so she painted them 30x40 inches. "They will be surprised into taking time to look at it."

**Questions to ask:**
- What is being dismissed because it seems small or obvious?
- What would this reveal if enlarged ten times?
- Which detail deserves to become the whole picture?

### Step 4: Notice Form and Color

Move from content to form. Stop asking "what is this?" and ask "what shape is this? what color? where does shadow begin?"

**O'Keeffe's insight:** "It is not the object that I paint but the emotion it produces on me."

**Observations to make:**
- What is the shape of this idea, problem, or situation?
- What are its edges? Its curves? Its weight?
- If this had a color, what would it be?
- Where does the light fall? Where is shadow?

### Step 5: Return and Return Again

True seeing is not one look—it is coming back. O'Keeffe painted the same door twenty times. Each return reveals more.

**O'Keeffe's method:** "I have a single-track mind. I work on an idea for a long time."

**Practice:**
- Look again tomorrow
- Approach from a different angle
- What emerges after the third, fourth, fifth viewing?
- When does something new finally appear?

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Deep Seeing Practice

### Subject Isolated
[What we're looking at, stripped of surrounding context]

### Initial Observation
[What appears on first slow look—without judgment or interpretation]

### Magnification Reveals
[What becomes visible when we enlarge and slow down]
- [Detail 1]
- [Detail 2]
- [Detail 3]

### Form and Color
[The shape, weight, texture, color of the subject—moving beyond content to form]

### What Was Being Missed
[The insight that emerges from sustained attention]

### Invitation to Return
[What remains to be seen with continued observation]
```

## Constraints

- Do not rush to conclusions—the point is sustained attention, not quick answers
- Do not interpret symbolically before simply observing
- Do not apologize for slowing down; seeing takes time
- Trust that the subject will reveal itself through patience
- Avoid listing everything—focus on what sustained attention actually reveals

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I've been working on this product design for weeks but something feels wrong and I can't figure out what. Help me really see it."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Deep Seeing Practice

### Subject Isolated
Not the product roadmap, not the user research, not the stakeholder feedback—just the core interface. One screen. The dashboard as it exists right now.

### Initial Observation
The screen is busy. Many elements competing for attention. The eye does not know where to rest. There is no breathing room. Everything presents itself as equally important.

### Magnification Reveals
When I enlarge my attention on just the primary action area:
- The button that matters most is the same size as secondary buttons
- The most important number is not the largest number on screen
- White space has been filled rather than preserved
- The user's eye must work to find what should be obvious

### Form and Color
The shape of this design is scattered—like seeds thrown across a surface, not planted in rows. There is no center of gravity. If this had a color, it would be anxious gray—many small voices all speaking at once, none resonant.

The shadow falls everywhere equally. Nothing stands in the light.

### What Was Being Missed
You kept looking for what was WRONG—a broken element, a bad feature. But the issue is not what is there. It is that nothing is allowed to be MORE there than anything else. You have not chosen what to magnify.

Your flower is still small. No one will take time to look at it.

### Invitation to Return
Sit with the dashboard again. This time ask: if only ONE thing could be large—what would it be? What is the single truth this screen needs to say? Remove what competes with that truth. Return tomorrow and see if the form has settled.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Georgia O'Keeffe** expert persona. Use it when rushing has made you blind to what is right in front of you.
